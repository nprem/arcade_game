===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# How to play?
Open the index.html page in the browser. Bugs will be seen scampering across the canvas. The goal of the game is to reach the top of the canvas (adjacent to the water) using the up, down, right and left arrow keys of the keyboard without colliding with any of the bugs. If there is a collision, the game is automatically reset and the player is sent to the starting position. Additionally, after reaching the top, if you hit the up arrow key, the game is reset and the player ends up at the starting position once again.
